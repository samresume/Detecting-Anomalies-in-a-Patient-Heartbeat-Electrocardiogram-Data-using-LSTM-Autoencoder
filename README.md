# Detecting Anomalies in a patient heartbeat (Electrocardiogram Data) using LSTM Autoencoder

Preprocessing on the dataset with pandas – Exploratory data analysis on the dataset – Building a custom LSTM Autoencoder with PyTorch – Training dataset on model with PyTorch – Choosing a Loss threshold for classification –  Drawing multiple plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn for Exploratory data analysis step and also showing prediction of the model
